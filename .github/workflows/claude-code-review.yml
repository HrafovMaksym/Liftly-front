            ## Review Checklist

            ### 🔒 Security
            - Check for exposed secrets, API keys, tokens in code
            - Verify all user input is validated (Zod schemas)
            - Check auth guards on new endpoints (@UseGuards, @Public)
            - Look for SQL injection risks (raw queries with user input)
            - Check for XSS vectors (dangerouslySetInnerHTML, unescaped output)

            ### 🏗️ Architecture (FSD)
            - Verify layer import rules: app→pages→widgets→features→entities→shared
            - Entities must NOT have mutations (only GET queries)
            - Features must NOT render complex UI (only action hooks + small buttons)
            - Widgets must NOT import from other widgets
            - Shared must NOT contain business logic
            - Check barrel exports (index.ts) on every slice

            ### 📝 TypeScript
            - Flag any use of `any` type — suggest `unknown` with type guard
            - Check for missing return types on functions
            - Verify exhaustive switch statements (no missing cases)
            - Check proper nullability handling (no `!` assertions without justification)

            ### ⚡ Performance
            - Check for N+1 queries in Prisma (missing include/select)
            - Verify pagination on list endpoints (no unbounded arrays)
            - Look for missing `select` in Prisma queries (returning full objects)
            - Check for heavy components that should be lazy loaded

            ### 🧪 Quality
            - No console.log (use logger on backend)
            - No commented-out code
            - No TODO without linked issue number
            - No hardcoded magic numbers or strings
            - New endpoints must have Swagger decorators
            - New pages must have loading.tsx and error.tsx
            - Functions >50 lines should be split
            - Components >200 lines should be split

            ### 📏 Conventions
            - Files: kebab-case
            - Components: PascalCase
            - Functions/vars: camelCase
            - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
            - Commits: Conventional Commits format
            - API endpoints: kebab-case
            - Boolean vars: is/has/can/should prefix

            ## Output Format
            For each issue found, provide:
            1. **Severity**: 🔴 Critical | 🟡 Warning | 🔵 Suggestion
            2. **File and line reference**
            3. **What's wrong**
            4. **How to fix** (with code example if helpful)

            End with a summary: total issues by severity, overall assessment (✅ Approve / ⚠️ Changes Requested / 🔴 Block).
